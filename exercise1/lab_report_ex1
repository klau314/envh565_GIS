Exercise 1
1. How does the map change when you move data up and down?
- Data moved to the top of the display order appears at the
forefront of the display, while data moved to the bottom of
the display order falls to the back. For example, when the 
WA_TRI_2012 file is at the top, those data points appear in
the foreground, on top of the other shapefiles.

2. Can you describe the census boundaries? Which are larger:
census block groups or census tracts?
Census tracts are larger.The census boundaries seem generally
squiggly, with a few straight line segments in places. The sizes
of groups varies significantly.
